# BZFlag Green Team AI
<br>
Currently, the BZFlag bots use Jon's implementation for assignment 3 with Professor Chin's method pointer example.
<br> 
<br>
**Installation:**
<br>
Clone the repository into a directory using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/jlarobello/ICS462-Shootout-Green-Team.git
```
<br>
Then on windows:
  1. Find your bzflag source directory and paste in the files (except for the README.md) into the bzflag directory.
  2. Make sure that you have applied all fixes from the [ICS 462 website](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~chin/462/Welcome.html).
  3. Make sure that you have included the [YAGSBPL](https://github.com/subh83/YAGSBPL) in Visual Studio project properties.
  4. Rebuild the solution to avoid unexpected errors.

<br>
**A few more things:**
  1. PLEASE do not commit or merge anything into the origin and your local repositories master branch. Instead, do the pull request directly on github or Jon will get mad ^-^. This is so your code can be reviewed before being merged. 
  2. If you create your own branch to do your own developments, please make sure to include a summary in your README.md so we know what the hell you are doing.
  3. Also, I am fairly new to git so don't feel bad if you're a newb because we are all newbs ^-^. 
  4. That's it
  
Much mahalos and Aloha! :3
